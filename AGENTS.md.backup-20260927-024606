# Cross-device continuation policy

<!-- PROJECT_HANDOFF_POLICY_START -->

## Session startup

Before performing meaningful project work:

1. Read `docs/handoff/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` when present.
2. Read and follow the `project-handoff` skill.
3. Treat the handoff file as continuation context, not unquestionable truth.
4. Verify important state against the actual repository/workspace before making changes.
5. If the handoff conflicts with verified repository state, trust the verified state and record the discrepancy in the next handoff update.

## Mandatory session handoff

After any meaningful:

- implementation
- bug fix
- refactor
- configuration change
- architecture/design work
- testing/debugging
- deployment preparation
- migration work
- project planning that changes future implementation

you MUST use the `project-handoff` skill before giving the final response.

Update:

`docs/handoff/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`

This is a completion requirement, not an optional documentation step.

Do not finish the task first and leave the handoff for a later session.

## Handoff scope

The handoff must capture enough verified state for another device or session to continue without asking the user to restate prior work.

At minimum record:

- session objective
- completed work
- files changed
- decisions made
- verification/tests
- known issues
- exact next action
- environment/config requirements
- cross-device readiness

## Secrets

Never place secret values, credentials, tokens, passwords,
private keys, cookies, session data, or `.env` contents in handoff documentation.

Allowed:

- environment variable names
- secret file names
- service names
- Firebase/GCP/Cloudflare project aliases or IDs when non-secret
- configuration requirements

## Git policy

Codex may inspect Git state when necessary for accurate documentation.

Actual Git operations such as:

- clone
- init
- add
- commit
- pull
- push
- remote changes

are performed by the user unless the user explicitly changes this policy.

## Final response requirement

After updating the handoff, include a short confirmation:

`Cross-device handoff updated.`

If the handoff could not be updated, explicitly state why.
